### Hackathon Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Findora / Yellow Submarine.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
We do not expect projects to be fully deployed to Findora mainnet - please attach as information in an organized way that is legible. 

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that do not need to be part of the application:
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the ZKP landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (Findora/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Ethereum / Findora ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
