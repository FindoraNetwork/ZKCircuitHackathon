- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
  * We are not a centralized social network product clone, we reshape the social community by building on top of blockchain, and adopt multi crypto native protocols

Things that do not need to be part of the application:
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
  * 1,000,000,000 CMTX token created at genesis, CMTX locked in governance to vote, 3-year circulating supply. Allocation as Core team: 20%, Foundation: 38%, Early investors (Angel / Seed): 15%, Token round(A, B, C): 12%, Community: 15%

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the ZKP landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  * We give data rights back to users and protect their privacy by utilizing Findora ecosystem to hide transaction details to avoid target tracking and hacking
- Who is your target audience (Findora/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  * Findora / dApp / wallet developers and other web 3 users
- What need(s) does your project meet?
  * We build on top of layer 1 blockchains like Findora to protect users privacy
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Ethereum / Findora ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  * We cooperate with several crypto partners like Livepeer, GateChain.io, Arweave to grow the community
